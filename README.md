# UFOs

### Overview of Project
Today we are helping Dana provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by adding multiple filters. We are going to add the city, state, country and shape filters to our original date filter to give the user a deeper analysis. 

### Results
As you can see in the image below, by typing in the certain filters we are able to break down the location, time and shape we are looking for. In the image below, I typed in the year and the city and came up with one only UFO sighting in that location. We can pick and choose which filter we would like to choose to see which works best for us.

### Summary 
The biggest drawback is how limited the dataset is, the last part of data was done years ago. Trying to find include updated information along with not just being limited to the United States will increase the amount of viewers that go on the site. First recommendation is to increase the dataset and include it in the code we already have. By updating the dataset to more current times, it will make the search for the user more worth it. The second recommendation is to make the website more visually appeasing, currently we are working on beginner code but as our skills increase we should make the site more visually appeasing to the user.
